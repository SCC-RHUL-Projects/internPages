SHAWN (Secure High Availability Wireless Network) is a framework of protocols which aspires to replace some of the wired communication networks used between onboard aircraft computing systems with a wireless equivalent.

This would be done with the intentions of reductions in cable design, installation, and maintenance costs, in addition to reducing fuel consumption and emissions by reducing weight. As part of the SHAWN project, a demo was built at RHUL. During this project, the SHAWN demo will be polished, and any nagging issues related to the reliability of the demo will be addressed.
