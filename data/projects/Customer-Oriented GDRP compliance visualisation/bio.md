Following the introduction of the European Union's new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) companies are required to become more transparent about their data management usage activities towards their consumers. This regulation has the potential to push forward the organisation's privacy responsibility and transparency practices further -- give access to the organisation's consumer to a portal where they can see in real-time how their data is being used by the organisation.

For such an open, transparent and potential route to gain market competitiveness for an organisation requires the design and deployment of a consumer-focused visualisation platform -- the overall objective of this project. This project aims to both help with and evaluates this compliance by creating a user interface that displays a given user's private information and if the usage of that data is GDPR compliant.

This project aims to create a user-focused visualisation of the usage of their own private information. To achieve this, we will do the following:
-   Experiment with the visualisation of privacy information
-   Design a visualisation of a given privacy information dataset
-   Perform eye-tracking based evaluation and surveys to evaluate the performance of the visualisation
