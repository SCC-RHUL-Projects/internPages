This project builds upon my earlier project undertaken as part of the UROP 2017 at the SCC. The output of that project resulted in an innovative idea to make data provenance for a single database instance. Building on top of that project, this project will design the data provenance collection framework for a MongoDB deployed as a cluster. Overall the aims of the project are as below:

-   Collection in clustered environments.
-   Low overhead to the overall cluster
-   No single point of failure
-   Provenance collection and storage for the whole of cluster
