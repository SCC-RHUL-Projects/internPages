In this project, we explore the visualisation techniques that can allow us to see the real-time flow of personal and private information through a network and show any potential policy violations as they occur. The objective is to build an intuitive visualisation platform that can facilitate a user to understand and assess the activities being performed in a network.

Any visualisation created during this project must be:
-   Simple enough to be worth using
-   Powerful enough to merit using it instead of looking at raw logs
-   Multi-layered, to convey specific meanings and concepts at each level of a network (networks, subnets, hosts, ports, services)
