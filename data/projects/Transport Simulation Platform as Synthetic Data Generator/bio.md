The purpose of this project is to construct a simulation based on a public transport system using open source information to extract later any required synthetically generated data.
-   Explore methods of obtaining available public transport data systematically.
-   Created techniques to apply the above data in a way relevant to this project.
-   Finally, use the above to create a simulation that approximates real-world transport as closely as possible given the data obtained.
