The objective of this project is to assess whether the usage of a user's data is within the parameters or violates the defined privacy policy. Therefore, during the project, the main activities will be:
-   Identifying and understanding data regulations relating to user data and privacy (for example GDPR)
-   Identifying and understanding consumer/user data requirements
-   Learning and experimenting with machine learning models (deep learning) to analyse large-scale enterprise data activities to assess whether a violation regarding consumer/user data occurred
-   Predicting with probability weighting whether a sequence of events leads to a data regulation violation
