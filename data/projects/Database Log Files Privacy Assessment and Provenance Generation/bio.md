Digital technologies touch every aspect of modern life. These technologies collect, retain and process information regarding entities that also includes humans. The fundamental construct for retention of information is databases. For reliability and (recently) security purposes databases employ robust logging mechanisms. In this project, we look into logging mechanism of four Database Offerings:
-   Select 2 SQL and 2 NoSQL database systems.
-   Generate test data that is the same in all 4 database systems.
-   Get log files from all 4 databases.
-   Analyse these log files for privacy-related data and their implications in the context of the GDPR.
-   Write a script to translate all 4 log files into one intermediate language, which can then be converted into data provenance.
