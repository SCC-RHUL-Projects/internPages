Kaloian, just Kal for convenience, came to Holloway in 2016 to study Computer Science with an emphasis on software engineering. He is an international student from Bulgaria with a vast background in IT and is also the current Vice President of the university's Computing Society. He can be found on most open days or on the RHUL Hall Life marketing material, which he very much doesn't remember consenting to.
