## SHAWN Wireless Demo Automation
SHAWN (Secure High Availability Wireless Network) is a framework of protocols which aspires to replace some of the wired communication networks used between onboard aircraft computing systems with a wireless equivalent.

This would be done with the intentions of reductions in cable design, installation, and maintenance costs, in addition to reducing fuel consumption and emissions by reducing weight. As part of the SHAWN project, a demo was built at RHUL. During this project, the SHAWN demo will be polished, and any nagging issues related to the reliability of the demo will be addressed.

## GDPR HUD: A Better Security Policy Visualiser for Enterprise Users.
In this project, we explore the visualisation techniques that can allow us to see the real-time flow of personal and private information through a network and show any potential policy violations as they occur. The objective is to build an intuitive visualisation platform that can facilitate a user to understand and assess the activities being performed in a network.

Any visualisation created during this project must be:
-   Simple enough to be worth using
-   Powerful enough to merit using it instead of looking at raw logs
-   Multi-layered, to convey specific meanings and concepts at each level of a network (networks, subnets, hosts, ports, services)

## Anonymous Ticketing using Blockchain
Anonymous ticketing, whether deployed in a high throughput and low latency environments like transport networks is an enormous challenge. As per requirements of such a system, for example, TfL requires the ticket processing within 300-500 milliseconds, any anonymous ticketing solution has to be efficient and does not need an internet connection (in most cases. In this project, we explore the potential of deploying an efficient ticketing framework that utilises blockchain (smart-contracts) technology to provide anonymity but within the strict requirements of the transport systems. To research methods of implementing an anonymous ticketing system using blockchain technology.
-   Evaluating the found methods and selecting the best option.
-   Designing a solution based on the method and implementing the solution by creating a software system/application that is usable and sustainable.
-   The designed solution should be efficient, reliable and secure

## Database Log Files Privacy Assessment and Provenance Generation
Digital technologies touch every aspect of modern life. These technologies collect, retain and process information regarding entities that also includes humans. The fundamental construct for retention of information is databases. For reliability and (recently) security purposes databases employ robust logging mechanisms. In this project, we look into logging mechanism of four Database Offerings:
-   Select 2 SQL and 2 NoSQL database systems.
-   Generate test data that is the same in all 4 database systems.
-   Get log files from all 4 databases.
-   Analyse these log files for privacy-related data and their implications in the context of the GDPR.
-   Write a script to translate all 4 log files into one intermediate language, which can then be converted into data provenance.

## Detecting Consumer-Oriented Privacy Violations as part of the GDPR User Portal.
The objective of this project is to assess whether the usage of a user's data is within the parameters or violates the defined privacy policy. Therefore, during the project, the main activities will be:
-   Identifying and understanding data regulations relating to user data and privacy (for example GDPR)
-   Identifying and understanding consumer/user data requirements
-   Learning and experimenting with machine learning models (deep learning) to analyse large-scale enterprise data activities to assess whether a violation regarding consumer/user data occurred
-   Predicting with probability weighting whether a sequence of events leads to a data regulation violation

## Monitoring and redirecting system calls on a Client Workstation
Monitoring events of a workstation is a difficult task since we have to decide on what level we want to track it. On the one hand, if the monitoring is on a superficial level, the system could be exploited by the user. Whereas when everything is monitored the amount of information gathered is on a scale which is not feasible to save. So, a trade-off between the vast amount of data tracked and what is collected is necessary. After the decision has been made about what is relevant to the privacy and security of the system this data is stored on a server which records these chains of events.

The primary objectives for this project are the following
-   Collect activities on a selected Operating System at a granular level (Kernel Level)
-   Filter the activity information and report only the most crucial events that have an impact on the overall security and privacy aspects
-   The reporting of the games will be structured as an event provenance that would be consumed to generate enterprise-wide causality chain.

## Causality in Enterprise System Activities
The goal of the overall project is to create a system that enumerates logs from across multiple sources in an enterprise, produces a full causality chain of events, and presents these in a user-friendly and easy to consume form. This goals of this section of the project include:
-   To create a connecting mechanism that connects isolated events together.
-   To create a format for the event chains that is easy to search.
-   To create a framework that evolves over time to capture new events.

## Data Provenance for Multi-Database Servers Enterprise Architecture
This project builds upon my earlier project undertaken as part of the UROP 2017 at the SCC. The output of that project resulted in an innovative idea to make data provenance for a single database instance. Building on top of that project, this project will design the data provenance collection framework for a MongoDB deployed as a cluster. Overall the aims of the project are as below:

-   Collection in clustered environments.
-   Low overhead to the overall cluster
-   No single point of failure
-   Provenance collection and storage for the whole of cluster

## Blockchain-Based Enterprise- and Consumer-Centric Data Provenance Integrity and Auditability
Blockchain technology (including smart contracts) are becoming mainstream in a multitude of applications -- ranging from cryptocurrencies, legal agreements, e-voting to e-health. In this project, we will explore how blockchain can be used together with the data provenance to provide assurance that all actions recorded in the provenance are an accurate representation of the activities performed on the data. Furthermore, to ensure that under GDPR when serving 'right-to-know' how the assurance can be provided to consumers that all report they have received is the correct and full picture of what has happened to their data.

## Customer-Oriented GDRP compliance visualisation
Following the introduction of the European Union's new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) companies are required to become more transparent about their data management usage activities towards their consumers. This regulation has the potential to push forward the organisation's privacy responsibility and transparency practices further -- give access to the organisation's consumer to a portal where they can see in real-time how their data is being used by the organisation.

For such an open, transparent and potential route to gain market competitiveness for an organisation requires the design and deployment of a consumer-focused visualisation platform -- the overall objective of this project. This project aims to both help with and evaluates this compliance by creating a user interface that displays a given user's private information and if the usage of that data is GDPR compliant.

This project aims to create a user-focused visualisation of the usage of their own private information. To achieve this, we will do the following:
-   Experiment with the visualisation of privacy information
-   Design a visualisation of a given privacy information dataset
-   Perform eye-tracking based evaluation and surveys to evaluate the performance of the visualisation
